            <h5 style="color:white"><span style="color: red; " >Change innovation </span> The most innovative competition I've ever participated in was a challenge that solely measured creative thinking without the need to create a prototype.<span style="color: red;">I led a group in this competition,</span>  and it not only enhanced 
                my leadership skills but also encouraged me to plan strategically. Each member of my group had three days to come up with a unique and fascinating idea, which was later presented and voted upon.

                After the three days, we all presented our ideas and the best concept was chosen through voting. Subsequently, we conducted research and created a comprehensive presentation. 
                Surprisingly, none of the participants chose the innovation they had initially come up with during the brainstorming period. Instead, everyone agreed to work on the project that received the highest score from the voting. 
                This decision allowed us to focus on the idea that had the most potential.
                The approach not only enabled us to think and research more efficiently than other groups but also provided us with extra time to create the best video presentation possible.</h5>

       <h5  style="color:white">Let talk about <span style="color: red;">PYROGUARD</span> PyroGuard is an intelligent robot capable of automatically extinguishing fires with precise accuracy, thanks to its combination of camera detection and IR sensors. This robot comes equipped with a fire suppression tank that can be activated using a nearby lever, integrated alongside tank treads similar to those found on tank-like vehicles, driven by two motors. This design allows PyroGuard to maneuver through damaged areas efficiently.

        The camera detection system enables PyroGuard to identify fire sources, while the IR sensors enhance its ability to detect and localize fires more effectively. With this sophisticated technology, the robot can autonomously navigate toward the fire and proceed to extinguish it, making it a reliable and efficient tool for fire suppression.
        
        By combining these features, PyroGuard becomes a valuable asset in firefighting scenarios, as it can respond rapidly to emergencies and reduce the risk to human firefighters. Its ability to act autonomously and accurately provides an innovative solution for fire safety and disaster management. </h5>
